# Comprehensive Data Engineering Solutions: Advanced SQL, Analytics, and Big Data Modeling

## Overview

Modern organizations require robust, scalable, and analytics-ready data solutions to drive business intelligence, advanced analytics, and operational efficiency. Raw data from diverse domains such as sports and entertainment is often unstructured and not immediately suitable for analysis or reporting.

## Project Objective

As part of the Data Engineering course from [dataexpert.io](https://dataexpert.io), the objective is to design and implement end-to-end data pipelines and data models that transform raw datasets into structured, high-quality, and query-optimized formats. The focus was on mastering dimensional modeling, fact table design, SCD Type 2, graph modeling, and advanced SQL for real-world analytics scenarios.

## Repository Structure

- **data/**: Contains all raw datasets used for modeling, including sports (NBA) and entertainment (film industry) data.
- **fact_data_modelling/**: SQL scripts for building analytics-ready fact tables, deduplication, aggregation, and user activity modeling.
- **Dimensional_data_modelling/**: SQL scripts for dimensional modeling, SCD Type 2, and graph-based data models for advanced analytics.

## Outcomes

Throughout this learning journey, I have gained hands-on experience and exposure to:

- **Data Engineering Fundamentals:** Dimensional and fact modeling, SCD Type 2, and historical data tracking
- **Advanced SQL:** Aggregation, deduplication, time-series analysis, and complex data transformations
- **Big Data Tools:** Exposure to PySpark, Flink, and Kafka for scalable data processing and streaming (course modules)
- **Data Governance & Quality:** Emphasis on data quality, maintainability, and best practices for analytics-ready solutions
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Building models that support business intelligence, retention analysis, and network analytics

This project suite reflects a deepening understanding of modern data engineering concepts and industry practices, with a focus on building scalable, high-quality, and production-oriented data solutions.

## Ongoing Learning

I am currently learning PySpark to further enhance my skills in distributed data processing and big data analytics.

## About Me

I'm a data enthusiast passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights. With hands-on experience in data engineering, data science and analytics. I enjoy building scalable pipelines, designing efficient data models and uncovering patterns through advanced SQL and statistical techniques.
